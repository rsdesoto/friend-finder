# friend-finder

Are you lonely? Do you wish you had an undead ghoulfriend to share eternity with? Sure, you have a house tucked away in the dark spaces between the stars, but -- without a partner who speaks only obscenities in a long-dead tongue, is it truly a _home_? Have you been looking for love in all the wrong haunted bogs? Try Cryptid Companion, the new cryptid4cryptid companionship app!

## Instructions

(Note: please enter a real URL for the photo. Currently there is no functionality to upload your own photo, but it would be nice to display your glistening flesh carapace to other users.)

Navigate to the [home page](https://best-cryptid-friend-finder.herokuapp.com/). Feast your eyes upon the fearsome body of the Mongolian Death Worm; enter the app at your own peril.
