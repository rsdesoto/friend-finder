Are you lonely? Do you wish you had an undead ghoulfriend to share eternity with? Sure, you have a house tucked away in the dark spaces between the stars, but -- without a partner who speaks only obscenities in a long-dead tongue, is it truly a _home_? Have you been looking for love in all the wrong haunted bogs? Try Cryptid Companion, the new cryptid4cryptid companionship app!
